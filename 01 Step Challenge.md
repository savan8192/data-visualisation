## Visualisation for Step Challenge Progress ##
 - The cost of organising a step challenge, through a third party, can set back a team by a couple of thousand of ££ in the UK if not 10s of thousands of ££.
 - Simple visualisation we created doesn't cost to implement and achieves the purpose of motivating a team to be active and healthy.s
 - This visualisation displays user exercise progress as part of a step challenge.
 - Users regularly submit their exercise data through a web-based form.
 - The submitted data is collected and stored in a spreadsheet, which serves as the data source.
 - The spreadsheet data is imported into a PowerBI dashboard to provide interactive and insightful visual analytics of participants' progress throughout the challenge.
