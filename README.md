## Data Visualisation ##
Hi there,
This is my repo to showcase some of the data visualisation work I have done over the past few years. Most of the work I have done is on PowerBI and with one off projects on Tableu, Superset and Metabase. Data Visualisation I created was to
- Display results/progress of a step challenge.
- Display learning and development status/progress of a team.
- Track efforts of various team members to pursue clients for a future project
- Present data analysis for a charity
